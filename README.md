Right Side of the Bed provides all the information you need to get out of bed and out the door on time, whether that be to work, school, or another destination of your choice (or, letâ€™s face it, obligation). 

Instead of visiting multiple applications and getting distracted in the process, Right Side of the Bed cuts out the noise of social media and internet rabbit holes to give you the commute time, weather, and latest headlines to help you get to your destination on time and informed. 

To start your day out on a positive note, we have also provided some music that has good vibes only and a few daily moves to get your blood moving.

Contributors of this project include Ashley Shaw (ashbshaw), Joe Scholz (JoeScholz), Cait Sidener (cait-sidener), and Perla Ordonez (pordonez93).
